## Welcome to My Growth Book

This is a digital archive of Huixin's life. It contains my academic studying, frisbee progress, and *book & movie* comments.

### Knowledge Generation

I have been using the title *Knowledge Generation* for some time. It is a synthesis of my studying materials. I take notes of what I learned, give feekbacks and put them here. We've had four happy years together, all the way from Advanced Mathematics, Signal Processing, Microprocessors to my Ph.D. life. I wish for tons of more.

*Generation* means two things.  First, it represents a dynamic growth of my knowledge arsenal. Second, it reminds me of my values. I am just one tiny bit within a limited period of time. *Going down the road with my eyes open*, as the Dylan song goes. Had I ever dreamt of anything, it should be to live in a generation of knowledge, to be around things that I understand. It is my wish and passion.

I am going down the road.
